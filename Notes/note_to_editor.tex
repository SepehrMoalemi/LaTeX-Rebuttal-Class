    Dear Professor Olaru,

    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    On behalf of my co-author, Prof. Forbes, and I, we thank you for the opportunity to re-submit our work to IEEE Control Systems Letters.

    We have incorporated the reviewers' helpful comments into our revised submission and addressed each comment individually in the attached rebuttal document. 
    
    Per the reviewers' suggestions, we have expanded the discussion in Section~IV to better present the applicability and benefits of the proposed \emph{discrete-time} passive-systems interpretation of the gradient descent (GD) method.

    Moreover, to further highlight that we consider the \emph{discrete-time} passivity-based analysis of the GD method, we are submitting the revised manuscript under the title ``Input-Output Stability of Gradient Descent: A Discrete-Time Passivity-Based Approach''.

    We believe that our contributions are now more clearly presented, and the benefits of our proposed passivity-based analysis are more thoroughly discussed.

    Thank you for your time,\\[1em]%
    \theauthor
