Three Reviewers with diverse expertise have assessed the manuscript.

Reviewer 1 observes that
\vspace{-7pt}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item {%
        the contributions are building on standard results
    }%
    \item{%
        of the four claimed contributions, only the first two are actually reported in the manuscript with sufficient detail
    }%
    \item{%
        as for the third contribution, the approach is taken from existing literature and does not appear rigorous
    }%
    \item{%
        both the third and the fourth contribution are explained with insufficient detail and thus unclear.
    }%
\end{itemize}

Reviewer 7 highlights that
\vspace{-7pt}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item {%
        claiming the first contribution is inappropriate, because something similar has already been done in the past
    }%
    \item{%
        the main contribution is in any case minor (a small modification / reformulation) and its benefits are unclear
    }%
    \item{%
        the manuscript does not offer any insight that was not known before through other methods
    }%
    \item{%
        the third contribution raises concerns and the benefits of the presented approach appear to be minimal
    }%
\end{itemize}


Reviewer 8 points out that, although the work is mostly technically correct, apart from e.g.\ a missing technical assumption on the boundedness of the sub-differential of the objective function,
\vspace{-7pt}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item {%
        a vast literature has been neglected (see the works of Notarstefano, Na Li, Dorfler, Pavel, etc)
    }%
    \item{%
        the presented results are well known, even in more general terms (see D. Gadjov and L. Pavel, ``A Passivity-Based Approach to Nash Equilibrium Seeking Over Networks,'' in IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, vol. 64, no. 3, pp. 1077-1092, March 2019, doi: 10.1109/TAC.2018.2833140.)
    }%
    \item{%
        the conclusions in the numerical results section are therefore to be expected
    }%
    \item{%
        the control theoretic and system theoretic interpretation to the gradient descent algorithm in convex optimization have already been proposed in previous literature
    }%
    \item{%
        all in all, no novel theoretical, practical or technical contribution can be found in the manuscript
    }%
\end{itemize}

In light of the serious concerns expressed by the Reviewers, the novelty and significance of the contribution appear insufficient for a journal paper. They might be considered as a potential conference contribution for ACC, at the discretion of the program committee.
