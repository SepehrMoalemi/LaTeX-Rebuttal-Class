    Dear co-authors,

    As acknowledged by the EiC, we received your rebuttal letter, and we analyzed the points you exposed.

    We also asked for the opinion of an external expert to reach a decision on the request to reconsider your submission. In short, we reached the agreement to reconsider the decision and to offer you the possibility to submit a revised version responding point to point to the reviewers and including the changes and clarifications you find necessary. Exceptionally, this will undergo a third review round. In this respect, a manual update is necessary in PaperPlaza. You will be able to see the novel status and the associated deadline shortly. 

    In preparing your revised version, you may consider the following points:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item{%
            clarify the role of the feedthrough term with respect to the general GD formulation (in the GD method in itself and with respect to the closed loop);
        }%
        \item{%
            detail the links evoked in Section IV.A and stress the novelty or the added value of the results; 
        }%
        \item{%
            specify if there is any claim of improvements in the performance/convergence of GD.
        }%
    \end{itemize}

    Best regards,\\[1em]%
    Sorin Olaru
